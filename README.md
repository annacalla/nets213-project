# NETS213 Final Project

The goal of this project is to answer the questions of how well turkers can moderate tweets on Twitter and if their personal political ideology affects their moderation decisions. The project is broken down into four main phases: first gathering data and designing MTurk hits, then running a quality control module, then running the aggregation module and finally writing the research report for the findings. 

The major milestone for the first phase is manually collecting input data of 100+ tweets about COVID-19 and the 2020 election. This section involves a lot of manual and repetitive work so it is worth 4 points. 

Using this information the next step is answering questions such as the political ideology of each Turker and how they apply content moderation. The main milestone for the second phase is using the processed data (political ideology, moderation etc.) and running a quality control module which involves filtering Turker responses that donâ€™t meet certain criteria. This phase is also very repetitive but less intensive than phase 1, so it is worth 2 points. We will likely also need to redesign and re-run our HIT from phase one in order to garner an adequate sample of responses, which should be worth 3 points.

The aggregation module is the main component of the third phase. It involves using Python to conduct data analysis and visualization on the quality controlled responses to answer the research questions. This is the most important section and open-ended section in the methodology, so it should be worth 4 points - 2 points for data analysis and 2 points for visualization creation. 

Finally, the main component of writing the research report includes summarizing our findings, presenting data-driven conclusions, and describing implications for future research. This is the most decisive and labor intensive part of the project so it should also be worth 4 points.
